How do you handle priority based scenario for different projects ?
We are using  a JIRA ticketing tool where all the individual projects will be raising their concerns and issues.

We have catergorised it as

Issues
Improvements
Maintenance
 
For issues, we have labels L1,L2,L3 and we have designated resource allocated for differnet tickets.
We have TAT (turn around time) for PROD (6 hrs), PRE-PROD (12 hrs), UAT (1 day) in this way , we will manage.

We have dedicated resources(I mean team members) allocated for new projects getting onboarded to check the incoming traffic and work accordingly.

How do you support and your inputs to the team ?

For collecting the logs and metrics , management recommended one of the tools called dynatrace which I have installed on UAT on around 6 servers and collected the logs and observed the kubernetes cluster for few days, which i found few results.

1. Overall cluster utilization increased to 80%, previosuly it was in between 40 to 55%.
2. Some of applications were running quite slow which has the EDL jobs in their applications.
3. Since it is using high components of cluster, I submitted all the details with the metrics and telemetry for the cluster.
Now we are exploring for other tools like apache kafka 

Telemetry --> process of recording the behaviour of your systems and collecting the metrics of the platform.

Major Issues solved 
I work in all the environments like UAT, Preprod, Dev, Production.

Since all the platform is based on security, we have all the certificates installed from the endpoint applications which calls our api.
There was one issue where certificate was provided from  one of the applications but the app was still down, 

I checked and troubleshooted that one of the chain certificates were missing ,
We will have

Main
Intermediate 1
Intermediate 2
Root 

The intermediate 1 certificate was missing from their end, post installing all the certs it worked
